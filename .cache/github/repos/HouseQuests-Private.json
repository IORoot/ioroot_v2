  "readme_content": "![header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IORoot/HouseQuests-Private/refs/heads/master/header.jpg)\n\n# HouseQuests\n\nThis is an electron app that boasts the ability to combine results from multiple\nUK housing websites into a single map. See housequests.com for details.\n\nThis was a private repo that I had built in an authentication server, but have since\ndecided to make it public with the hope of interest from other people.\n\n## Starting project\n\n```bash\nnpm run start\n```\n\n##  Release Management\n\nTo create a new release of the HouseQuests electron app, you can run:\n```bash\nnpm run release\n# or\nnpm run build\n```\nThis will place all new distribution files into the `./dist` folder.\n\nSecret scanning enabled on repo.\n\n\n###  Publish release on github \n\nThere is an adjacent github repo that just hosts the releases. This is at: https://github.com/IORoot/HouseQuests\n\n1. Give a version release tag to the local repo.\n\n```bash\ngit tag v0.1.15      # Add a tag to current branch\n```\n\nOther commands:\n```bash\ngit tag            \t\t\t\t\t# List all tags on current branch\ngit tag -d <NAME>   \t\t\t\t# Delete tag\ngit push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.16\t# Delete tag on github (delete local first)\n```\n\n2. Push the tags to GitHub\n\n```bash\ngit push --tags\n```\n\nThe automated GitHub action will build the windows and mac distributable files and add them to the 'releases' page.\n\nNote that a release will **NOT** run the tests before releasing.\n\n\n\n## Apple Quarantine\n\nApple says the file is damaged and cannot be open it's because it has been quarantined it. \n\nRun the following command:\n\n```\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/HouseQuests.app\n```\n\n## 5. Folders\n\n```bash\n#main application\n/app\n\t/client \t\t# main electron app\n\t/lib\t\t\t# bundled libraries and files\n\t/maps\t\t\t# bundled maps\n\t/services\t\t# node server backend\n\n# webpack-build config files\n/build\n\n# npm environment config\n/config\n\n# production-ready distribution files\n/dist\n\n# icons and install images\n/resources\n\n# HTML and electron files. Builds into /app folder.\n/src\n\n# Mocha Tests\n/tests\n\n```\n\n## 5. Making MacOS Icons\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/jamieweavis/b4c394607641e1280d447deed5fc85fc\n\n## 6. MacOS Code-signing.\n\nDisable code-signing by setting the environment variable before creating the app.\n```\nexport CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false\n```\n\nhttps://disable-gatekeeper.github.io/\n\n## 7. Testing\n\nThe WebdriveIO / Mocha tests NEED the `/dist` release to run against.\nMake sure you have done an `npm run release` to build the release before testing.\n\nAlso, set the environment variable 'HQ_TEST=test' to disable the 10-second advert\n\n\n## 8. Tailwind\n\nTo create a new`./app/views/style.css` file, you'll need to run TailWind.\n\n```\nnpx tailwindcss -i ./src/views/style.css -o ./app/views/style.css --watch\n```\n\nTo build it for production:\n\n```\nnpx tailwindcss -i ./src/views/style.css -o ./app/views/style.css --minify\n```\n\n\n## 9. VSCode debugging\n\n.vscode/launch.json in vscode:\n\n```\n{\n    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.\n    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.\n    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"node\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"name\": \"Launch Program\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}/HouseQuests-Private\",\n            \"runtimeExecutable\": \"${workspaceFolder}/HouseQuests-Private/node_modules/.bin/electron\",\n            \"windows\": {\n                \"runtimeExecutable\": \"${workspaceFolder}/HouseQuests-Private/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd\"\n            },\n            \"args\" : [\".\"],\n            \"outputCapture\": \"std\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
