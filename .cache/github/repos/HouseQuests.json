As much as I'd want to support and bug-fix this application, Its not feasible for me to be able to commit to that. So this github repo is for people to communicate through the issues page and help each other solve any problems. I'll comment when I can. \n\n\n## Issues\n\nSign up for a github account and submit your issues through the 'issues' tab (see above) on this page. \n\nWhen adding an issue, please try to add an appropriate label to categorise it.\n\n\n## Wiki\n\nThe main wiki and documentation is on the website at [HouseQuests.com/docs](https://HouseQuests.com/docs). You can find decriptions and help for most features of the application there.\n\n\n## Free\n\nThis repository is just a location for all the releases when it was a paid applicaâ ion. Now everything is free - head over to the private repo here:\nhttps://github.com/IORoot/HouseQuests-private\n\n",
