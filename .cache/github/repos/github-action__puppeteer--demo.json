I've made this a little more verbose and included some\ntry/catch blocks to demo better javascript structure.\n\nThere is one \"class\", called `runner`, that has one publid method called: `run`.\n\nYou can see at the bottom we execute the class with:\n```javascript\nrunner.run();\n```\n\nThis in-turn, will call the `publicRun` method in the class - which will step through the try/catch blocks.\n\n\n###  2.4. <a name='githubworkflowspuppeteer.yml'></a>.github/workflows/puppeteer.yml\n\nThe workflow action only has a manual `workflow_dispatch`, so you'll have to go into the 'actions' tab on github and\nmanually run the action.\n\nThis repo demonstrates the usage of the github action \"IORoot/action__puppeteer--media@master\" which will run a \ndocker container with an instance of puppeteer in it. \n\nTo use the action, it's a matter of running youre commands like so:\n\n```yaml\n    - name: Test Code\n      uses: IORoot/action__puppeteer--media@master\n      with:\n        args: npm install\n```\n\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n###  2.5. <a name='BuiltWith'></a>Built With\n\nThis project was built with the following frameworks, technologies and software.\n\n* [Github](https://github.com/)\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n##  3. <a name='Usage'></a>Usage\n\nGithub Actions.\n\n##  4. <a name='Customising'></a> Customising\n\nNone.\n\n##  5. <a name='Troubleshooting'></a>Troubleshooting\n\nNone.\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n##  6. <a name='Contributing'></a>Contributing\n\nContributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.
