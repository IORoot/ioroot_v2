The chromium version that puppeteer uses does not have video codecs installed.\n2. Most of the puppeteer actions on the marketplace lack any decent documentation. Which meant it was hard to get anything running.\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n###  2.1. <a name='BuiltWith'></a>Built With\n\nThis project was built with the following frameworks, technologies and software.\n\n* [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/api)\n* [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)\n* [Github](https://github.com/)\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n###  2.2. <a name='Installation'></a>Installation\n\n\n###  2.3. <a name='NewRepositoryPackage.json'></a>New Repository & Package.json\n\nCreate a new github repository and include a package.json file.\n\n```\n/package.json\n```\n\nIn the dependencies, you will want to include 'puppeteer-core',\n\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"prunner\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"author\": \"Andy Pearson (https://ioroot.com)\",\n    \"description\": \"Allows you to run puppeteer scripts.\",\n    \"license\": \"MIT\",\n    \"main\": \"puppeteer.js\",\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"puppeteer-core\": \"^5.4.1\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n###  2.4. <a name='Yourpuppeteerscript.'></a>Your puppeteer script.\n\nNext, you'll want to include your own script that will run puppeteer and do whatever\nit is you want it to do.\n\n```\n/myscript.js\n/package.json\n```\n\nThis script will need to reference chrome in a specific location: `/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable`\n\n```js\n\n    const puppeteer = require('puppeteer-core');\n    browser = puppeteer.launch({ \n        headless: true, \n        devtools: false,\n        executablePath: \"/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable\",\n        args: ['--no-sandbox']\n    });\n\n```\n\nYou should now be able to run your puppeteer steps in your script.\n\n\n\n###  2.5. <a name='GithubAction'></a>Github Action\n\nLastly, to run the whole process, you need to create a github action workflow file.\n\n```\n/.github/workflows/run_action.yml\n/myscript.js\n/package.json\n```\n\nThis workflow action will include the bare minimum of:\n\n```yaml\nname: Demo puppeteer script\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n\njobs:\n  demo:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n\n    # Copy contents of this repository into runner.\n    - uses: actions/checkout@master\n\n    # Run the \"Args\" as a command in the docker container\n    # created by this action. 'npm install' will run.\n    - name: Install\n      uses: IORoot/action__puppeteer--media@master\n      with:\n        args: npm install\n\n    # Run the \"Args\" as a command in the docker container\n    # created by this action. 'node myscript.js' will run\n    - name: Test Code\n      uses: IORoot/action__puppeteer--media@master\n      with:\n        args: node myscript.js\n\n```\n\n\n###  2.6. <a name='package.jsonscripts'></a>package.json 'scripts'\n\nInstead of running the `node myscript.js` in the 'args', you could transfer the execution\ninto the package.json like so:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"prunner\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"author\": \"Andy Pearson (https://ioroot.com)\",\n    \"description\": \"Allows you to run puppeteer scripts.\",\n    \"license\": \"MIT\",\n    \"main\": \"puppeteer.js\",\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"puppeteer-core\": \"^5.4.1\"\n    },\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"start\": \"node myscript.js\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou could then run `npm run start` as the command in 'args'.\n\n```yaml\n    - name: Test Code\n      uses: IORoot/action__puppeteer--media@master\n      with:\n        args: npm run start\n```\n\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n##  3. <a name='Usage'></a>Usage\n\nGithub Actions.\n\n##  4. <a name='Customising'></a> Customising\n\nNone.\n\n##  5. <a name='Troubleshooting'></a>Troubleshooting\n\n\n###  5.1. <a name='NoteaboutVideoCodecsinChromium.'></a>Note about Video Codecs in Chromium.\n\nIMPORTANT - Some puppeteer scripts will not run correctly when using a version of chromium that\nhas NOT been compiled with the video/audio codecs. Chrome comes with them as standard\nbut Chromium does not.\n\nManually, You can download a copy of Chromium with those codecs here:\nhttps://chromium.woolyss.com/ to query these routes.\n\nYou can then set the `executablePath` of puppeteer-core in the puppeteer settings\nto point to this version of chromium.\n\nWarning - If you do not do this, then chromium will not upload any videos because \nit will not recognise those file formats. Images will work, however.\n\nWhy did I need this? Well, I had created a puppeteer script that was navigating to\nthe facebook creator studio and uploading an instagram video. However, it would not\nwork because chrome couldn't handle the MP4 files being uploaded. So a different \nversion was required.\n\n```php\n/**\n * ISSUE - CHROMIUM NOT ABLE TO UPLOAD VIDEO\n * \n * https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/291\n * \n * Chromium cannot upload video, however, Chrome can. This is \n * because chromium is compiled without any codec support. Therefore,\n * use a chromium version WITH support or use Chrome.\n * \n * You can download a chromium version here:\n * https://chromium.woolyss.com/#mac-stable-ungoogled-marmaduke\n * \n * Change the executablePath to a google chrome instance\n * executablePath: \"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\"\n */\n ```\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n##  6. <a name='Contributing'></a>Contributing\n\nContributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.
