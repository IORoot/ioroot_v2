If you add `-test` in the commit message, the action will disable.\n\n\n##  4. <a name='Customising'></a> Customising\n\n\nThis was initially created to scrape a Ghost.org blog for IORoot hosted on Heroku.\n\nWhy Heroku? Well, it's free. And you can link a DB and CDN to the free instance. So Ghost will work on it.\n\nOnce I've made any changes on Heroku, I'd head over to github and run this action.\n\nThe action would scrape the heroku dyno and generate a static version of the website. \n\nIt then pushes the result over to Netlify.\n\nThe github action has a single variable called `scrapetarget` that you can point anywhere.\n\n##  5. <a name='Troubleshooting'></a>Troubleshooting\n\nNone.\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n##  6. <a name='Contributing'></a>Contributing\n\nContributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.\n\nIf you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue.\nDon't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!\n\n1. Fork the Project\n2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)\n3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)\n4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)\n5.
