However, having some experience with Puppet, I built it to be modular and usable on any system.\n\nYou can use it to setup you dotfiles, scripts, programs and software, configs, etc... \n\nIt's also multi-system. So you can create a separate profile for each of your machines (based on their name) to install different things.\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n###  2.1. <a name='BuiltWith'></a>Built With\n\nThis project was built with the following frameworks, technologies and software.\n\n- [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n###  2.2. <a name='Installation'></a>Installation\n\nThese are the steps to get up and running.\n\n1. Clone the repo in home directory.\n    ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/IORoot/motd ~\n    ```\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n##  3. <a name='Usage'></a>Usage\n\n1. Run the install script.\n    ```sh\n    ~/scripts__tools/install\n    ```\n\nThis will use the `default` profile if no others have been created to match your machine name.\n\n\n##  4. <a name='Customising'></a> Customising\n\n\n### Profiles Folder\n\nWithin the `/profiles` folder there is a simple file with the name of your host. To create a new one, simply type `hostname` on your commandline and create a new file with that name.\n\nEach profile lists all of the things you wish to install.\n\nExample:\n\n    ```\n    install \"homebrew\"\n    install \"ohmyzsh\"\n    install \"powerlevel10k\"\n    install \"zshrc\"\n    install \"aliases\"\n    install \"env_vars\"\n    install \"paths\"\n    install \"hb-jq\"\n    install \"scripts\"\n    install \"fonts\"\n    ```\n\nEach one of these runs a script called `install_$SCRIPT.sh` in the `/installers` folder\n\n### Installers Folder\n\nThe installer will detect which architecture and operating system you are using from:\n- MacOS\n- Ubuntu\n- CentOS\n\nIt will then run the corresponding install scripts from that installer folder `/installers/macos`\n\n### Scripts Folder\n\nThe `/scripts` folder is where all of the extra files to reference and use during installation.\n\n### Install Scripts\n\nEach install script `/installers/$OS/install_$SCRIPT.sh` will run if it is referenced in the profile.\n\nWhen writing a new script, add a few things:\n\n1. A check for a file/path/folder/link to see if it's already run.\n\n```\nif [ -L ~/.paths ]; then\n    ...\nelse\n    ...\nfi\n```\n\n2. The 'Already Installed' message\n\n```\nif [ -L ~/.paths ]; then\n    printf \"Already Installed\\n\"\nelse\n    ...\nfi\n```\n\n3. The 'Done' message.\n\n```\nif [ -L ~/.paths ]; then\n    printf \"Already Installed\\n\"\nelse\n    printf \"DONE\\n\"\nfi\n```\n\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n##  6. <a name='Contributing'></a>Contributing\n\nContributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.\n\nIf you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue.\nDon't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!\n\n1. Fork the Project\n2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)\n3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)\n4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)\n5.
