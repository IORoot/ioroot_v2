Query YouTube / Instagram for specific videos and download the results (video file, post content, meta, etc).\n1. Automatically create some cover art.\n1. Combine the videos to create a quick trailer.\n1. Export the results to my social media.\n\nThis then became the components of the pipeline project:\n\n1. [API Scraper](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--api-scraper)\n1. [Generative Images](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--generative-images)\n1. [The Processor](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--processor)\n1. [Exporter](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--exporter)\n\n\n##  3. <a name='AboutTheProject'></a>About The Project\n\nThe API Scraper was a project born out of wanting to build parkourpulse.com. Using wordpress, I wanted to pull various query data out of youtube and present it in a nice way.\n\nThis plugin grabs the data, filters it, maps it to post objects, imports them, housekeeps any old data and puts it all on a schedule.\n\n![scraper](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__api-scraper/blob/master/files/images/SCRAPER.png?raw=true)\n\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n###  3.1. <a name='BuiltWith'></a>Built With\n\nThis project was built with the following frameworks, technologies and software.\n\n* [Youtube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs)\n* [ACF Pro](https://advancedcustomfields.com/)\n* [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/)\n* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)\n* [PHP](https://php.net/)\n* [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n###  3.2. <a name='Installation'></a>Installation\n\n> This was built with ACF PRO - Please make sure it is installed before installing this plugin.\n\nThese are the steps to get up and running with this plugin.\n\n1. Clone the repo into your wordpress plugin folder\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--api-scraper ./wp-content/plugins/pipeline-api-scraper\n    ```\n1. Activate the plugin.\n\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n##  4. <a name='Usage'></a>Usage\n\nThe API Scraper Wordpress plugin will allow you to get data from various API endpoints and output the results as posts into your custom post types / taxonomies. \n\nThis plugin is quite complicated and requires a lot of configuration. It was built to be a general Scraper rather than a specialised one that focuses on a single API.\n\nIt has many very powerful features that can be quite dangerous if not used correctly. However, this is also it's strength.\n\nFor more detailed usage, please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__api-scraper/wiki).\n\n\nBelow is a brief description of each tab in the system:\n\n###  4.1. <a name='Scrape'></a>Scrape\n\nThe main controller. The 'scrape' tab allows you to select all of the other components that make up the scrape you're going to run.\n\n![scrape](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__api-scraper/blob/master/files/images/Scrape.png?raw=true)\n\n###  4.2. <a name='Authenticate'></a>Authenticate\n\nAny authentication methods for youtube APIs or other API's can be setup here.\n\nThis is handy for creating multiple youtube accounts and using them for different API Scrapes.\n\n\n![auth](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__api-scraper/blob/master/files/images/Authenticate.png?raw=true)\n\n###  4.3. <a name='Search'></a>Search\n\nThe search is the main component of *how* you are going to use the YouTube API. You can specify what your search query will be.\n\n![search](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__api-scraper/blob/master/files/images/Search.png?raw=true)\n\n###  4.4. <a name='Filter'></a>Filter\n\nThe filter is run once your search query has returned results. It will perform any dynamic filters required on the results.\n\n![filter](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__api-scraper/blob/master/files/images/Filter.png?raw=true)\n\n###  4.5. <a name='Mapping'></a>Mapping\n\nOnce the data has been retrieved and filtered you need to specify how your wordpress posts will be populated with that data.\n\nTitle, Post content, Images, Meta fields, etc... Map sources data to destination fields.\n\n![map](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__api-scraper/blob/master/files/images/Mapping.png?raw=true)\n\n###  4.6. <a name='import'></a>import\n\nThe mappings have been defined, but now the scraper needs to import the generated post into a particular post-type, taxonomy, category, etc...\n\n![import](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__api-scraper/blob/master/files/images/Import.png?raw=true)\n\n###  4.7. <a name='Housekeep'></a>Housekeep\n\nEverything is running smoothly and you're generating content. However, you're not removing any old posts or data you don't want anymore. The housekeeping tab allows you to manage this.\n\n![housekeep](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__api-scraper/blob/master/files/images/Housekeep.png?raw=true)\n\n###  4.8. <a name='Schedule'></a>Schedule \n\nOnce everything is ready to go you can put it on a scheduled timer. Now you'll be getting your up-to-date scrape data without you having to manually run it.\n\n![schedule](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__api-scraper/blob/master/files/images/Schedule.png?raw=true)\n\n\n##  5. <a name='Customising'></a>Customising\n\nPlease refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__api-scraper/wiki)\n\n##  6. <a name='Testing'></a>Testing\n\nThis plugin has PHPUnit tests built in. These are all located in the `/tests` folder. The config file is in the root of the plugin `phpunit.xml.dist`.\n\nYou also have a demo dashboard in the `/files/` folder that can be used to show example data.\n\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n##  7. <a name='Contributing'></a>Contributing\n\nContributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.\n\nIf you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue.\nDon't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!\n\n1. Fork the Project\n2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)\n3.
