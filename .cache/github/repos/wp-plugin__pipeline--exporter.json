Query YouTube / Instagram for specific videos and download the results (video file, post content, meta, etc).\n1. Automatically create some cover art.\n1. Combine the videos to create a quick trailer.\n1. Export the results to my social media.\n\nThis then became the components of the pipeline project:\n\n1. [API Scraper](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--api-scraper)\n1. [Generative Images](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--generative-images)\n1. [The Processor](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--processor)\n1. [Exporter](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--exporter)\n\n##  3. <a name='AboutTheProject'></a>About The Project\n\nThe pipeline project was built to automatically build, process and export generated posts. This plugin is that last part of the process. The exporter connects with various endpoints and APIs to send those generated posts to.\n\nOriginally I wanted all social media, but eventually whittled it down to YouTube, Google-My-Business, Trello, Creator Studio and REST Endpoints.\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n###  3.1. <a name='BuiltWith'></a>Built With\n\nThis project was built with the following frameworks, technologies and software.\n\n* [ACF Pro](https://advancedcustomfields.com/)\n* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)\n* [PHP](https://php.net/)\n* [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)\n\nYou will need the following extra plugins to work:\n\n- HTTPS Must be working on the site / vagrant\n- [ACF Pro](https://advancedcustomfields.com/)\n- [https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__oauth--YouTube](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__oauth--YouTube)\n- [https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__oauth--GMB](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__oauth--GMB)\n- [https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__acf--inline-datetime-field](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__acf--inline-datetime-field)\n\nThese plugins will allow you to do an OAUTH connection to the specific service. They are ACF buttons that will complete the hand-shake \nwith the google APIs. These need to be configured and running (with a `client_secret.json` created) for the authentication to work.\n\n(optional) The following plugin will make the code boxes look better.\n- [https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__acf--codemirror](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__acf--codemirror)\n\n\n###  3.2. <a name='Anoteaboutthecreative-studiointegration.'></a>A note about the creative-studio integration.\n\nThis is purely a test interface to my other project [https://github.com/IORoot/docker__puppeteer--facebook](https://github.com/IORoot/docker__puppeteer--facebook).\nThat project is a  docker container that hosts a webserver to a puppeteer script. That script will navigate to creator-studio and attempt to post your video or image to Facebook and Instagram.\nI created this to circumvent the lack of API to those services.\n\nThis plugin has an authentication and exporter method for that service, but you'll have to host that yourself. You can build the container and host it at a particular IP address. The authentication in this plugin will export to that address.\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n###  3.3. <a name='Installation'></a>Installation\n\n> This was built with ACF PRO - Please make sure it is installed before installing this plugin.\n\nThese are the steps to get up and running with this plugin.\n\n1. Clone the repo into your wordpress plugin folder\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--exporter ./wp-content/plugins/pipeline-exporter\n    ```\n1. Activate the plugin.\n\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n###  3.4. <a name='StepsbeforeactivatingAUTHplugins'></a>Steps before activating AUTH plugins\n\n1. Make sure you do a `composer install` or `composer update` in each before activating \n1. Also, make sure the `client_secret.json` file is placed in the root of each OAUTH plugin. (See below)\n\nThere is a .gitignore on the file `client_secret.json`, so you don't commit it to a repo by accident.\n\n###  3.5. <a name='Check'></a>Check\n\nIf the auth plugins are working, you will see a new 'LOGIN WITH YOUTUBE' button on authentication tab on the exporter plugin for youtube.\n\n###  3.6. <a name='GoogleMyBusiness'></a>Google My Business\n\nIs one of the only client-libraries that is NOT part of the standard `google/apiclient-services`, so you have to download it yourself.\nYou can get it here: https://developers.google.com/my-business/samples/previousVersions\n\nPlace it into the `/GMB` folder.\n\n###  3.7. <a name='OAUTHKeys'></a>OAUTH Keys\n\nHead over the the google console https://console.cloud.google.com/ and create a project with the following APIs:\n\n- YouTube Data API v3\n- Google My Business\n\nThe google my business API is a private one and you need to request access from google for it.\n\nCreate an OAUTH 2.0 client ID and download the `client_secret.json` file: place it into the root of the plugin.\n\n##  4. <a name='Usage'></a>Usage\n\nThis usage documentation is split between the main plugin and the exporters. This is because there are multiple exporters, each with their own interface which work differently. Therefore, see that section to find out how they work.\n\n###  4.1. <a name='Authentication'></a>Authentication\n\nThe authentication tab connects the plugin to the third-party services. There are currently four different methods:\n\n1. YouTube. Uses the ACF OAUTH Button for youtube.\n2. Google-My-Business. Uses the OAUTH Button for GMB.\n3. Trello. This requires:\n    - API Key. A valid API key obtained from trello.\n    - Token. A valid token obtained from trello.\n4. IG-Scheduler. This connects to the [https://github.com/IORoot/docker__puppeteer--facebook](https://github.com/IORoot/docker__puppeteer--facebook) project hosted in a docker container. It needs:\n    - Username. Facebook CreatorStudio account with a linked Instagram account.\n    - Password. Facebook password for creator studio.\n    - API Key. Set in the `auth.json` file in the [https://github.com/IORoot/docker__puppeteer--facebook](https://github.com/IORoot/docker__puppeteer--facebook) project.\n    - IP Address. Where the container is being hosted and the express.js webserver is being run.\n\n![authentication](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--exporter/blob/main/files/docs/authentication.png?raw=true)\n\n###  4.2. <a name='Job'></a>Job\n\nA job allows you to select variations of settings to run.\n\n- Enabled.

Pick which housekeep method to use for this job.\n- Schedule. Pick which schedule to use for this job.\n\n![Job](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--exporter/blob/main/files/docs/Job.png?raw=true)\n\n###  4.3. <a name='Content'></a>Content\n\nThe content is the body of the post you are going to use when exporting. This will be the text in your video or image post.\n\n- Enabled. List this as an option to use in 'jobs'. Turn on or off.\n- Content ID. The identifier to use when listed in the 'jobs' tab.\n- Content Input. \n    - Query. Use a WP_QUERY array to select which posts to export.\n    - Posts. Manually select which posts to export.\n\n![Content](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--exporter/blob/main/files/docs/Content.png?raw=true)\n\n###  4.4. <a name='Export'></a>Export\n\nThis is where you configure the specific exporters to use and the targets. Please see the next section for a description of each exporter.\n\n- Enabled. List in the 'jobs' tab or not.\n- Export ID. The name of the export instance to list in the 'jobs' tab.\n- Export Target Mapping. Add multiple targets:\n    - Google My Business\n    - YouTube\n    - Trello\n    - REST\n    - Creator Studio\n\n- Available Moustaches. These are special variables you can use in the textboxes and textareas on the exporters. For instance, you could use `{{0_post_name}}` in the `Title` field of your youtube exporter and it will substitute the first (0) post's `post_name` into the title.\n\n> Note that since the query will return an array, the variable name will have a prefix of the index. `{{0_post_name}}`, `{{1_post_name}}`, `{{2_post_name}}` ...\n> The meta-fields have a prefix with double underscores since they, themselves, are arrays.\n\n![Export](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--exporter/blob/main/files/docs/Export.png?raw=true)\n\n###  4.5. <a name='Housekeep'></a>Housekeep \n\nOne the exporters have run, you might want to remove posts from the system so they don't get exported again. The housekeeping tab allows you to do that.\n\n- Enabled. List in the 'jobs' tab or not.\n- Housekeep ID. The name of the housekeeping instance to list in the 'jobs' tab.\n- Housekeep Action. What to do with the posts that are returned from the query.\n    - Bin Posts. Soft delete - can be recovered in the trash.\n    - Delete Posts.

You can use the web interface to tell the puppeteer script how to work. The puppeteer script will login to Creator studio as you, create a new post, upload your video, schedule it and then post.\n\nThis exporter will connect to the express.js API and send the details required to kick off the puppeteer script.\n\n\n##### Instance \n\n- Enabled. Run this exporter or not.\n\n- Instance Description. Any extra notesfor yourself to remember about this exporter. What it does, where it goes, etc...\n\n![export-instagram-instance](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--exporter/blob/main/files/docs/export-instagram-instance.png?raw=true)\n\n##### Content\n\n- Post Caption.

Declare the name of the endpoint you are going to create. This URL can then be used to query for the post you are exporting. \n```\ndomain.com/wp-json/pipeline/v1/exporter/[ENDPOINT_ROUTE_NAME]\n```\nYou can use IFTTT.com or Zapier.com to query this new endpoint for the posts.\n\n- WP_Query Arguments. This is an array to pass into a 'get_posts()' function. The query here will be used, NOT the query in the 'content' section of the exporter.\nThe results will be displayed on the endpoint to be parsed.\n\nAn example:\n\n```php\n[\n    'post_type' => 'exporter',\n    'post_status' => 'publish',\n    'order' => 'DESC',\n    'numberposts' => 2,\n]\n```\n\n\n\n![export-rest-endpoints](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--exporter/blob/main/files/docs/export-rest-endpoints.png?raw=true)\n\n##### Help\n\nExtra details for reference.\n\n###### REST API\nThis exporter instance will declare a new REST endpoint for services like zapier.com or IFTTT.com to point at.\n\n###### Endpoint Route\nThe endpoint route is the word or url path to be declared by WordPress. Any service that points to this new URL with a GET request will have the results of the content query returned.\n\n###### WP_Query Arguments\nThis query will run when the endpoint is hit. Note that the query in the `content` tab of the exporter will NOT be used. This overrides it.\n\n###### Enabled\nMake sure that the export group is enabled. Otherwise the REST endpoint will not work.\n\nDue to the code, all endpoints WILL be defined and will work if the the export is enabled, regardless of whether there is a job associated with it.\n\n![export-rest-help](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--exporter/blob/main/files/docs/export-rest-help.png?raw=true)\n\n\n\n##  6. <a name='CustomPostType.'></a>Custom Post Type.\n\nThis plugin also comes with a custom post type (CPT) called \"exporter\" that you can use to export your output to. This can be used as a intermediate step before exporting off to your third-party apps.\n\nThe \"Exporter\" CPT will appear in the admin sidebar sidemenu.\n\n\n\n##  7. <a name='Troubleshooting'></a>Troubleshooting\n\n###  7.1. <a name='OAUTHIssues'></a>OAUTH Issues\n\n\n1.
