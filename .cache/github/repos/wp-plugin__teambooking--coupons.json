  "readme_content": "# Stripe Payments plugin --> Teambooking coupon\n\nNOTE - The 'output_coupon' shortcode has been depreciated. It uses transients instead of sessions.\n\nThis plugin will bridge the gap between the stripe payments plugin (https://s-plugins.com/) and TeamBooking plugin. (https://stroheimdesign.com/)\n\nWhen someone purchases a gift-card, through the stripe payments plugin, the returning action\nwill run this plugin and generate a coupon code for TeamBooking to be used by the buyer.\n \n## Workflow of Plugin\n \n1. The asp_stripe_payment_completed ACTION is run after the stripe payment is made.\n\n2. My hook taps into this action and runs the create_coupon() function with all stripe data\n    passed to it.\n\n3. The create_coupon() will determine which payment has been made and create a TeamBooking\n    Coupon Object and set its values.\n\n4. The create_coupon() function will pass the new coupon object to the TBGenerateCoupon class\n    constructor which runs the database insert with the data.\n\n\n## This is the workflow of the standard TeamBooking Coupon creation.\n\n1.   /js/admin.js : 360\n    This file will use the private API to send a POST to call the action 'tbk_add_coupon'.\n    Uses the Wordpress AJAX API (https://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins) to send the request.\n\n2.   /src/TeamBooking/Admin.php : 97-100\n    Declares that when the 'admin_post_tbk_add_coupon' action is encountered (from the JS file above),\n    run the 'insertPromotionCoupon' function. This is basically creating an API for the Javascript.\n\n3.   /src/TeamBooking/Admin.php : 2085\n    The 'insertPromotionCoupon' function creates the coupon. This is the function to tap into.\n",
