  "readme_content": "# How the stripe functionality works.\n\n## Observations\n\n### The webhooks\n   \nTeambooking will register a URL to stripe.com as a webhook page. That page is:\n`https://londonparkour.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=teambooking`\n\nThe event that stripe.com will send to this URL is: `checkout.session.completed`\n\n### Creating webhooks in stripe.com\n   \nThe webhooks are created every time the teambooking page is saved or updated. When the return URL is changed, a new webhook is registered with stripe.com\n\n### The return URL\n\nIs NOT the webhook address.\n\n### The PAGE CACHE\n\nThis WILL interfere with the sessions. Make sure cache is cleared.\n\n### Workflow Steps\n\n1. User fills in fields on booking form.\n2. Stripe payment button will appear.\n3. Redirected to stripe payment page.\n4. Stripe new payment is created. `payment_intent.created`\n5. Stripe new customer is created. `customer.created`\n6. Stripe payment details & method is attached to new customer `payment_method.attached`\n7. Stripe charges payment method. `charge.succeeded`\n8. Stripe payment status changed to succeeded. `payment_intent.succeeded`\n9. Stripe sends a `checkout.session.completed` event to the registered webhook address.\n10. User will be redirected to the 'Registered' webpage.\n\n### The JSON sent to the webhook address\n\n```\n{\n  \"id\": \"evt_1G5W1uGtEGgLrOjaPEgGQlRn\",\n  \"object\": \"event\",\n  \"api_version\": \"2018-02-28\",\n  \"created\": 1580125522,\n  \"data\": {\n    \"object\": {\n      \"id\": \"cs_test_IDGOESHEREANDISLONGSTRINGOFCHARACTERS\",\n      \"object\": \"checkout.session\",\n      \"billing_address_collection\": null,\n      \"cancel_url\": \"https://londonparkour.com\",\n      \"client_reference_id\": null,\n      \"customer\": \"cus_GclZEtgrwKGqYT\",\n      \"customer_email\": null,\n      \"display_items\": [\n        {\n          \"amount\": 1000,\n          \"currency\": \"gbp\",\n          \"custom\": {\n            \"description\": \"Beginner Indoor | #1425\",\n            \"images\": null,\n            \"name\": \"A9j9KVMGbJu7Pz1Ifn0TjDeD2X9izvPt\"\n          },\n          \"quantity\": 1,\n          \"type\": \"custom\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"livemode\": false,\n      \"locale\": null,\n      \"metadata\": {\n      },\n      \"mode\": \"payment\",\n      \"payment_intent\": \"pi_1G5W1YGtEGgLrOjaqniXhz5K\",\n      \"payment_method_types\": [\n        \"card\"\n      ],\n      \"setup_intent\": null,\n      \"submit_type\": null,\n      \"subscription\": null,\n      \"success_url\": \"https://londonparkour.com/registered/\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"livemode\": false,\n  \"pending_webhooks\": 2,\n  \"request\": {\n    \"id\": null,\n    \"idempotency_key\": null\n  },\n  \"type\": \"checkout.session.completed\"\n}\n```\n\n### Not Working Checks\n\n1. Clear ALL Caches\n2. Remove All webhook addresses in stripe. Re-register them by changing the return URL and saving the 'Payment Gateways' page again.\n3.  Check the stripe webhooks to see if they are registered. \n\n\n\n# Change 2 - Schema\n\nSo the problem is that for event schema to work, you need a different URL for each event. This is per google's word... \nhttps://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/event?hl=en#integrate\n\nHowever, TeamBooking doesn't have pages for classes because it uses AJAX to load the content dynamically. Which means\nthis becomes complicated. So, the solution is:\n\n1. Use query parameters on the URL to specify an individual slot for the calendar widget. However, the issue with THAT is \n   there isn't a query parameter for individual slots, just specific days. So problem 1 is solved by adding in a new parameter\n   called `tbk_service` that once combined with `tbk_date` allows mee to individually specify a single slot on a speecific day.\n   That in turn give a unique URL for google to parse.\n2. Next, the problem of getting schema on that slot page.\n3. Also, we need to create a new sitemap for the next months worth of URL combinations for google to pick up.",
