[v2.0.0](#v2.0.0)\n\n\n##  2. <a name='AboutTheProject'></a>About The Project\n\nThis was a hugely stripped down version of the website because it was initially using the X-Theme from [Theme.co](https://theme.co/x)\nI was tired of the bloat that came with these types of themes and decided that being the supooseed web-developer that I am that I should actually do a little coding and create my own theme. I wanted to pull out everything that wasn't absolutely needed and code my own version of everything, as long as the overhead made sense.\n\nThis theme comes with a lot of plugins I wrote to enable me solve single problems with the minimum amount of code. No bloat or extra features that aren't required.\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n###  2.1. <a name='BuiltWith'></a>Built With\n\nThe theme DOES however require a couple of 3rd party plugins to run those are:\n\n1. ACF. Advanced Custom Fields PRO. https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/\n\n   This is the backbone of most of the custom functionality and admin options. Nothing will work without this.\n   \n1. Advanced Forms Pro. https://hookturn.io/downloads/advanced-forms-pro/ \n\n   A stellar plugin that sits alongside ACF. Create forms (This is for the contact form page) based on ACF fields.\n   \n1. Easy WP SMTP. https://wp-ecommerce.net\n\n   To get SMTP working with Google Email.\n\n1. Stripe Payments. https://www.tipsandtricks-hq.com/\n\n   To enable the gift-cards on the website. May reeplace this in the future with a custom plugin.\n   \n1. TeamBooking. https://codecanyon.net/user/vonstroheim\n\n   This is a fantastic plugin, well coded. This handles all of the class bookings and inteegration to google calendar.\n   \n1. WPBakery Page Builder https://wpbakery.com/\n\n   This is the WYSIWYG Page Builder I use for rapid page creation. All custom plugins interface with this.\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n###  2.2. <a name='Installation'></a>Installation\n\nThese are the steps to get up and running with this theme.\n\n1. Clone the repo into your wordpress plugin folder\n      ```sh\n      git clone https://github.com/IORoot/wp-theme__londonparkour--v4 ./wp-content/themes/londonparkour_v4\n      ```\n1. Enable the theme in wordpress.\n\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n##  3. <a name='Usage'></a>Usage\n\nNo usage required.\n\n##  4. <a name='Customising'></a> Customising\n\nEdit the theme however you wish.\n\n##  5. <a name='Troubleshooting'></a>Troubleshooting\n\nThis is purely for LondonParkour.com. No troubleshooting.\n\n<p align=\"right\">(<a href=\"#top\">back to top</a>)</p>\n\n\n##  6. <a name='Contributing'></a>Contributing\n\nContributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.
