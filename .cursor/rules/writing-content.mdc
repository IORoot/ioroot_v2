[writing]
Treat readers like hunters
Understand that web visitors are actively seeking quick solutions—make your content easy to locate and clearly relevant from the start.

Lead with your most important information
Follow the inverted-pyramid structure: put key points, benefits, or conclusions upfront instead of building suspense.

Keep it simple—don’t be clever
Avoid clever turns of phrase or complex language; aim for clarity and ease of understanding.

Write for scanners
Use descriptive headlines, subheads, bullet lists, captions—so readers can grasp meaning by glancing.

Use familiar, care‑triggering words
Choose terms and phrases your audience uses and searches for—this creates relevance and connection.

Write as if the reader is “lazy”
Keep sentences short (≈12 words) and paragraphs minimal (≤4 lines), avoid jargon, unnecessary words, and passive voice.

Ensure every page stands alone
Because readers can land anywhere, include context, a clear purpose statement, and a call-to-action on every page.

Optimize for SEO and discovery
Focus each page on a single topic, include relevant keywords, and link to related content to help users—and search engines—find you.

Combine copy with visual clarity
Use images, headlines, bullet points, whitespace, and layout to enhance readability and visual focus.

Declutter and reduce noise
Strip away distractions—ads, sidebars, unnecessary widgets—and leave plenty of white space for trust and clarity.


[heirarchy]
These are rules to adhere by when writing content and establishing heirarchy in the content (what is most important vs least important)

- Contrast
Establish a clear base style
Define your primary text style (e.g. body copy at 11 pt regular or 14 px medium) — all other styles must visibly distinguish from this baseline 

- Use weight for emphasis
Prefer bold or medium weight over all-caps or color shifts when highlighting headings—it offers the strongest contrast 

- Size can compensate
If weight variation is limited, increase font size for headings to enhance their visual priority 
Prioritize color contrast
Ensure accessible (≥4.5:1) contrast for text on colored backgrounds—especially buttons—to improve visibility and hierarchy 

- Spacing & Grouping
Group related elements tightly
Reduce vertical spacing between items in the same group (e.g. transaction rows) to visually connect them 

- Separate distinct sections intentionally
Add extra space before headings or section titles, and less after — this clarifies structure and guides reading 

- Use background or subtle shading
Optionally use light backgrounds (e.g. grey behind income entries) to visually lift certain elements 

- Structure & Planning
Plan hierarchy levels beforehand
Before adjusting type, decide on actual content structure (goal, relevance, number of heading levels) to avoid over-styling 

- Simplify heading depth
Limit to ~4–5 heading levels—too many make typography unreliable for hierarchy indication 

- Implementation Strategy
Contrast first, then space
First establish hierarchy via size/weight/color contrast. Then refine grouping and relationships using spacing adjustments 



[content]
Rules for Writing Content People Will Actually Read

- Write for a Niche Audience
Focus each piece on a specific topic that aligns with your reader's interests—don’t try to please everyone.

- Make the Value Clear Immediately
Start with a hook or takeaway that tells the reader why they should care — front-load the benefit.

- Respect the Reader’s Time
Keep it concise, cut fluff, and avoid filler. People are scanning, not studying.

- Use Clear Structure & Headings
Break text into scannable chunks with clear subheadings so readers can skim or dive in selectively.

- Make it Easy to Save & Share
Provide value that’s worth bookmarking or sharing (e.g. summaries, lists, insights, templates).

- Avoid Information Overload
Focus on one core idea per post. If you have more, make it a series or link out to deeper content.

- Be Intentional About Links
Use internal or external links sparingly—only if they enhance, not distract from, the core message.

- Support Reading Later
Format your writing so it’s clean when saved in “Read Later” apps (no popups, minimal cruft, clear metadata).

- Build a Content Backlog
Plan ahead by keeping a running list of topic ideas and writing drafts gradually—don’t always publish reactively.



[seo]
- Research Thoroughly Before Writing
Conduct in-depth research using credible sources such as industry reports, expert interviews, or academic studies to ensure accuracy and originality.

- Identify & Satisfy Search Intent
Choose a primary keyword and align the content with the reader’s search intent (informational, transactional, or navigational).

- Focus on Audience Needs & Persona
Understand the audience's goals, questions, and pain points. Write content that is relevant, helpful, and tailored to them.

- Structure Clearly with Headings & TOC
Use a clear hierarchy of headings (H1, H2, H3) and include a table of contents if the article is long, so readers can navigate easily.

- Write Concisely with Short Paragraphs
Use short sentences and paragraphs. Aim for clarity and avoid unnecessary filler or overly complex language.

- Use Formatting to Highlight Key Points
Use bold text for important terms, bullet points for lists, and blockquotes for notable insights to increase scannability.

- Enrich with Visuals & Multimedia
Include relevant images, charts, or videos to support the text and explain complex concepts. Use alt text for accessibility.

- Provide Original Value & Expertise
Offer unique analysis, opinions, examples, or case studies. Don’t just rehash what’s already out there.

- Include Clear Intro & Actionable Conclusion
Start with a hook that outlines the benefit of reading, and end with a summary or call-to-action that tells the reader what to do next.

- Optimize & Iterate Post-Publish
Update and improve content over time based on performance data. Refresh content that underperforms and optimize what performs well.


[microcopy]
Plan Microcopy from the Start
Don’t treat UI text as an afterthought. Microcopy should be considered during the design phase and integrated with layout and functionality.

Write Contextually Based on User Intent
Anticipate what the user needs or worries about at each step, and write microcopy that directly addresses those needs.

Reassure Users Where Necessary
Help users feel confident by reassuring them—e.g. “You can change this later” or “No credit card required”.

Explain Why You’re Asking for Information
Add context for form fields or permissions—e.g. “We need your phone number in case your delivery is delayed”.

Mention Data Safety and Autosave When Relevant
Let users know their input is safe—e.g. “Your draft is saved automatically” or “We never share your data”.

Use Clear, Human-Friendly Language
Avoid technical jargon or robotic tone. Use natural, empathetic language that feels like a conversation.

Be Concise and Specific
Make microcopy short and purposeful—every word should guide, reassure, or clarify.

Use Microcopy to Improve Conversions
Small bits of helpful text can reduce friction and increase conversions—especially around forms, buttons, or signup flows.
