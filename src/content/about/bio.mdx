# About Andy Pearson

I'm a Lead DevOps Engineer at ThirtyThree Global with over 6 years of experience managing infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud resources across Microsoft Azure. I specialize in infrastructure-as-code using Puppet and Terraform, Kubernetes, and automated deployment workflows.

## Background

Born and raised in London, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity. My background spans DevOps engineering, web development, UI/UX design, and product strategy, with a particular focus on performance and user experience.

## Current Role

As Lead DevOps Engineer at ThirtyThree, I manage and evolve the infrastructure that powers our development team and client-facing applications. I lead the DevOps department, supporting developers with robust CI/CD pipelines, secure and scalable deployment workflows, and stable cloud environments.

## Beyond Tech

I'm also the founder and head coach of LondonParkour Ltd, with 20+ years of parkour coaching experience. I've coached thousands of students internationally and helped establish ParkourUK as the UK's first national governing body for parkour.

## Philosophy

I believe in building robust, scalable systems and fostering strong communities through movement and technology. Great software should be invisible - it should work so seamlessly that users forget they're using technology.
