## What I Do

I lead the DevOps department, supporting developers with robust infrastructure and stable cloud environments. My expertise spans automation, cloud management, and system reliability.

My core technologies include Puppet and Terraform for infrastructure-as-code, Linux virtual machines and BASH scripting, alongside Azure Cloud Services. I work extensively with GitLab CI/CD and GitHub Actions to create deployment workflows, monitoring, disaster recovery, incident response and developer support.

For monitoring and observability, I implement Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki to ensure system reliability and critical incident response. My operating system experience spans CentOS, Rocky Linux, and LAMP Stack environments.

On the development side, I work with PHP/Laravel and Concrete5, while maintaining security standards through OWASP ZAP testing and best practices.
