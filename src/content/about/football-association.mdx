## Website Testing Leadership

The project focused on migrating Manchester United's content management system to Sitecore while preserving the existing frontend design. My role was critical - ensuring the website continued functioning perfectly during this major backend transition. The testing covered everything from basic navigation to complex content management workflows.

I developed and executed test scenarios that validated the entire user experience. This included acceptance testing to ensure the system was ready for deeper testing phases, plus comprehensive browser compatibility testing across Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari. The goal was maintaining the website's reliability for millions of Manchester United fans worldwide.

## Content Management System Testing

The core challenge was testing the new Sitecore CMS integration without disrupting the existing frontend. I focused on two critical sections - News & Features and Fixtures & Results - ensuring content displayed correctly within existing wireframes. This required meticulous attention to detail, as any display issues would immediately impact user experience.

I validated that content changes in the new CMS accurately reflected on the frontend. This included testing permission levels for Translator and Editor roles, ensuring proper access controls were maintained. The testing approach prioritized high-impact areas first, then moved to medium and low priority items based on available time.

## Cross-Browser Compatibility

Browser testing was essential for Manchester United's global audience. I conducted comprehensive testing across Internet Explorer and Firefox, with additional testing on Safari for Mac users. This ensured the website remained accessible to fans worldwide regardless of their browser choice.

The testing identified and resolved compatibility issues that could have affected user experience. This was particularly important for a website serving millions of users with diverse technical setups and preferences.

## Quality Assurance Process

I established a systematic testing approach with clear entry and exit criteria. The process included defect tracking through custom bug spreadsheets, progress reporting to project management, and retesting until quality standards were met. This ensured no critical issues reached the live environment.

The testing timeline was tight - with a June 22nd launch date, I had limited time to complete comprehensive testing. I prioritized high-impact scenarios and created efficient test scripts that maximized coverage within the available timeframe.

## Key Impact

My testing ensured Manchester United's website migration to Sitecore CMS was successful. The project maintained website functionality while implementing a new backend system, preserving the user experience for millions of fans worldwide.

The systematic approach to testing prevented critical issues from reaching production. The website continued serving fans reliably during and after the CMS transition, maintaining the high standards expected for one of football's most visited websites.
