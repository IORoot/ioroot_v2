## E-commerce Platform Testing

The John Lewis Direct project required testing a sophisticated online retail platform serving millions of customers. I developed comprehensive test scenarios covering product catalogues, shopping carts, payment processing, and order management systems. The testing approach prioritized critical e-commerce functionality that directly impacted customer experience and business operations.

I focused on testing across multiple product categories including electronics, furniture, fashion, and home goods. The testing covered everything from basic product browsing to complex checkout processes. This included validating product images, descriptions, pricing, and availability across different categories and customer segments.

## Fraud Management and Payment Processing

I conducted extensive testing of John Lewis's fraud detection and prevention systems. This included testing credit card processing, authorization workflows, and fraud screening rules. The testing covered various payment scenarios including corporate orders, manual authorizations, and velocity rule testing for high-value items like iPods.

I validated the complete payment flow from order placement through authorization and fraud checks. This included testing for failed fraud checks, order cancellations, and customer communication systems. The testing ensured that legitimate orders were processed while fraudulent transactions were properly flagged and handled.

## Gift List System Testing

I tested John Lewis's sophisticated gift list and wedding registry system. This involved validating the integration between the main e-commerce site and the dedicated gift list platform. The testing covered product selection, list management, and the complex workflow between different customer touchpoints.

I validated gift list functionality including product addition, quantity management, and list sharing features. The testing ensured that gift list customers could seamlessly browse products, add items to their lists, and manage their registries across different platforms. This was critical for John Lewis's wedding and gift registry business.

## Customer Communications Testing

I tested comprehensive customer communication systems including email notifications, order status updates, and customer service workflows. This included validating email templates, delivery systems, and customer support integration. The testing covered various scenarios from successful orders to fraud-related cancellations.

I validated the complete customer journey from order placement through delivery confirmation. This included testing order confirmation emails, fraud notification systems, and customer service escalation processes. The testing ensured customers received appropriate communications at each stage of their order lifecycle.

## Load Testing and Performance

I conducted load testing to ensure the e-commerce platform could handle peak shopping periods. This included testing system performance under high traffic conditions, database response times, and payment processing capacity. The testing approach simulated real-world shopping scenarios to validate system reliability.

I developed test scenarios that mimicked actual customer behavior patterns including product browsing, cart management, and checkout processes. The load testing ensured the platform maintained performance standards during critical shopping periods like sales events and holiday seasons.

## Key Impact

My testing work ensured John Lewis Direct's e-commerce platform functioned flawlessly for millions of customers. The comprehensive testing approach covered all critical retail systems while maintaining security standards and customer experience quality.

The systematic testing prevented critical issues from affecting online sales operations. The platform successfully supported John Lewis's online retail business, maintaining the high standards expected for one of the UK's most trusted department stores.
