## Security Penetration Testing

The MatchesFashion project required conducting thorough security assessments of their e-commerce platform using Nikto v1.35/1.36 security scanner. I performed comprehensive vulnerability scanning that identified critical security issues including outdated software versions, potential PHP information disclosure, and server configuration vulnerabilities.

I conducted systematic security testing across 2052 different attack vectors, identifying 6 significant security vulnerabilities. The testing covered web server configurations, PHP application security, and potential attack vectors that could compromise customer data and business operations.

## Web Infrastructure Security Assessment

I identified critical security issues including outdated Apache/2.0.52 and PHP/5.1.2 versions that posed significant security risks. The testing revealed potential PHP information disclosure vulnerabilities through specific query strings that could expose sensitive server information to attackers.

I validated server configurations and identified potential attack vectors including TRACE method vulnerabilities that could allow cross-site scripting or credential theft. The security assessment covered both known vulnerability patterns and custom attack scenarios specific to the e-commerce environment.

## E-commerce Security Testing

I tested critical e-commerce functionality including user registration systems, payment processing security, and customer data protection. The testing included validation of secure communication protocols, session management, and data encryption standards required for luxury fashion retail.

I assessed the security of customer-facing systems including registration forms, user authentication, and order processing workflows. The testing ensured that customer data and payment information were properly protected against common web application vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Analysis and Reporting

I documented detailed security findings including specific vulnerability descriptions, risk assessments, and remediation recommendations. The security report included technical details about each identified vulnerability and prioritized recommendations based on potential business impact.

I provided comprehensive security recommendations including software updates, configuration changes, and security best practices. The testing approach focused on both immediate security fixes and long-term security posture improvements for the luxury fashion retailer.

## Key Impact

My security testing work identified critical vulnerabilities in MatchesFashion's e-commerce platform that could have compromised customer data and business operations. The comprehensive security assessment provided actionable recommendations for improving their security posture.

The systematic security testing prevented potential security breaches by identifying vulnerabilities before they could be exploited. The security improvements helped protect customer data and maintain the trust required for luxury fashion retail operations.
