## TV Equipment Management Testing

The Sky project required testing sophisticated TV equipment management systems handling millions of customer accounts. I developed comprehensive test scenarios covering equipment replacement workflows, subscription validation, and customer portfolio management. The testing approach prioritized critical functionality that directly impacted customer experience and business operations.

I focused on testing complex equipment replacement scenarios including SKY+ boxes, HD boxes, STB boxes, and IDTV systems. The testing covered everything from basic equipment selection to complex upgrade workflows. This included validating business rules for equipment compatibility, replacement eligibility, and subscription requirements across different customer segments.

## Business Rules and Validation Testing

I conducted extensive testing of Sky's business rules engine that managed equipment replacement and subscription validation. This included testing over 150 business rules covering equipment compatibility, subscription requirements, and customer portfolio management. The testing ensured that customers could only select valid equipment combinations and subscription packages.

I validated complex business logic including maximum equipment limits, subscription prerequisites, and equipment replacement eligibility. The testing covered scenarios like "Maximum 2 TV Boxes per transaction" and "Valid TV Channel combinations" to ensure system integrity. This was critical for preventing invalid configurations that could impact customer service.

## Customer Portfolio and Basket Management

I tested sophisticated customer portfolio management systems that tracked existing equipment and subscription status. The testing included validation of customer account states, equipment inventory, and subscription history. This involved testing scenarios where customers had existing equipment that needed replacement or additional equipment that could be added.

I validated complex basket management workflows including equipment addition, replacement, and removal processes. The testing covered scenarios like "Add Box Link" functionality and "Undo Replace Box" operations. The testing approach ensured that customers could manage their equipment selections seamlessly while maintaining system integrity.

## Subscription and Channel Package Testing

I tested comprehensive subscription management systems including TV channel package selection and validation. The testing covered scenarios like "SKY World" package selection and subscription requirement validation. This included testing the integration between equipment selection and subscription requirements.

I validated subscription workflow testing including package selection, equipment compatibility, and billing integration. The testing ensured that customers could select appropriate TV packages based on their equipment and that the system properly validated subscription requirements before allowing equipment changes.

## Quality Assurance and Process Improvement

I established systematic testing processes for Sky's TV equipment and subscription systems. This included comprehensive test coverage analysis, business rule validation, and user acceptance testing. The testing approach prioritized critical customer-facing functionality while ensuring system reliability and performance.

I developed test scenarios that covered all 150+ business rules identified in the system requirements. The testing included validation of equipment compatibility matrices, subscription requirement validation, and customer portfolio management workflows. This systematic approach ensured that all critical business logic functioned correctly.
