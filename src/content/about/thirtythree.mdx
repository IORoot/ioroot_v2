## Key Projects & Achievements

### Department Leadership
Successfully leading the DevOps department and spearheading all of the infrastructure needs and requirements of the Digital Team. The following projects were the major milestones during those years.

- **Infrastructure Migration**: One of the first major projects was to complete a full transfer of all systems, services, and virtual machines from Rackspace to a Capita-owned Azure subscription through the implementation of Terraform and our existing full Puppet IaC solution.

- **Upgrade Path**: Instigating, planning and building the DevOps Infrastructure and tech-stack from the original CentOS 7 VMs to a more modern Rocky 9 operating system which would support the latest LAMP stack; to Docker Containers, AKS Kubernetes Clusters, Azure ACR and GitLab CI/CD deployments. This also involved migrating from VirtualBox+Vagrant to Orbstack. 

- **Verion Control**: Supervising, Upgrading and maintaining our Gitlab installation as well as expanding it with a KAS Server and Azure CI/CD Cluster for Gitlab-runners.

- **Developer Deployment**: Providing robust tools and supporting the Developer team with their deployments. Our bespoke system uses a centralised single-source-of-truth service that allows a full code and database deployment across a dev / build / staging / live environments.

- **Test Pipelines**: Built a complete GitLab pipeline testing suite to enable one-off and scheduled runs of many different tools from OWASP, Lighthouse, Link checking, Browser Testing, Unit testing and many more.

- **Estate Monitoring**: As the estate grew, monitor was required. We installed, developed and evolved a Prometheus / Loki / Grafana solution with custom dashboards, tripwires and alerting for daily, weekly and monthly monitoring reports. 

- **Cloud Mangement**: Once in Azure, my role was to manage the infrastructure and build upon it. From NSGs and Firewalls, to Application-Gateways, Kubernetes Clusters, ACR, Vaults, Multi-region subnets and many more services.

- **Disasters and Incidents**: Led our incident response training and (Red-Team / Blue-Team) game-days to help prepare the digital team and company for disaster management and recovery procedures. Also ensure that we had a robust multi-tenant backup solution for all major services and client data. We required custom scripts and debugging tools for many scenarios involving DDOSing, security testing, system failure and resource saturation. 

- **Kubernetes**: The future of the ThirtyThreeGlobal infrastructure is to move onto a container-based system. I was tasked with learning, developing and building that infrastucture. This started with translating our existing tech-stacks into docker containers for local development and moved into rebuilding our deployment processes into a full Gitlab CI/CD Pipeline. The virtual machines would then be moved to a brand new Kubernetes Cluster and Azure Container Registry. Our unique needs of database migrations/deployment, DNSing, Certificate management and client requirements made this a complex, yet fun proof-of-concept system.

- **Other Services**: Alongside the core infrastructure I built, maintained or managed our other services which included a lot of BASH/Shell scripting, PagerDuty, Uptime-Robot/Uptime-Kuma, SSL certificates and CSR Requests, Our custom DNS solution and 'Redirector' service, Secrets Managment system, Documentation and Wiki accuracy.
