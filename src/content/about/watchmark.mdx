## Lead Implementation Engineer for WatchMark-Comnitel

**Aug 2004 - Nov 2004** · London Area, United Kingdom · Full-time

---

I was headhunted from ADC Telecommunications to join WatchMark-Comnitel as Lead Implementation Engineer. 

---

The role involved similar network performance management work but with different data sources and software systems. I began implementing the same type of network monitoring and data ingestion systems I had developed at ADC, adapting to WatchMark's specific telecommunications infrastructure and requirements.

After four months of establishing the implementation framework and beginning the core development work, the entire team was made redundant due to company restructuring. The role demonstrated my ability to quickly adapt network performance management skills to new environments and different technical requirements.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Network Performance Management**: Implementing monitoring systems for telecommunications infrastructure
- **Data Ingestion Development**: Adapting data processing systems for new network equipment and protocols
- **System Implementation**: Deploying network management software across different technical environments
- **Technical Leadership**: Leading implementation projects and coordinating with network operations teams
