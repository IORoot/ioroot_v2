# LondonParkour.com

Currently on version 7 of the website, this is my main pride-and-joy website. Hand-built wordpress theme and plugins alongside full stripe.com integration for class payments, mailchimp newsletters, seo, performance tuning and mobile-enhanced responsive design.

It uses ACF, slider-revolution, rank-math and stripe-payments plugins as well as the many custom-written plugins for everything from automated YouTube scraping, Social-Media Posting, Node Metrics and Custom-Post-Types with very complex heirarchies.

There are three stand-out technical solutions custom built for LondonParkour.com:

## 1. Classes and Booking

This is built around a plugin I wrote for scheduling and constructing a calendar of specific class posts on a regular basis with the correct details from a template for the specific class type.
From just writing a new class template with a schedule I can create a whole new booking system for a new class at speed. With stripe payments, google-maps, attached media, and detailed information tabs, this makes it very easy to manage the class booking system.
It also means that it can be left on auto-pilot to generate new classes and remove old classes as time passes. The integration with the stripe functionality, coupon purchases and hooking into an existing plugin proved difficult but ultimately worth it for the result.

## 2. Tutorials & Social-Media Posting

The social-media post plugin was built to help me automate my social media for LondonParkour. It utilises [make.com](https://make.com) to publish those videos with the help of my plugin sending a webhook JSON request to it.

## 3. Parkour Pulse API Scraping

The last main plugin was the API Scraper for YouTube/iTunes to generate curated video lists on the website for specific searches, playlists, groups of accounts and more. This was a major plugin for me at the time and really helped me delve deep into OOP with Wordpress and PHPUnit testing.
