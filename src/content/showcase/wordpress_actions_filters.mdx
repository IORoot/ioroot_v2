# Wordpress Simple Actions & Filters


Curse the gods, this simple functionality can seem complicated. I think its a combination of the terminology and word choice being so unhelpful. Do I `add` , `apply` or `do` a filter or action? What is a hook here? Or maybe I need to register it? It's all very vague, and I constantly forget.

Anyway, here's some pretty pictures instead. I've made it as basic as possible, more for remembering which one to use and where.

## 🧗🏻‍♀️ Basic Actions (does a task, returns nothing)

Plug in new code at a specific point.


```mermaid
flowchart TB

    subgraph callback["Registered Callback Function"]
        callback_function["run_this_function($args)"]
    end

    subgraph codeflow["Normal code flow"]
        direction TB
        code1["code"]
        do_action["do_action( 'my_action_name', $arguments )"]
        code2["code"]

        code1 --> do_action
        do_action --> code2
    end

    subgraph register["Registered Action"]
        add_action["add_action( 'my_action_name', 'run_this_function', $priority, $number_of_args)"]
    end

    do_action --> register
    register --> callback

```


1.  Once you've registered your action with a `my_action_name` in functions.php or a plugin, you can now call it. 
    
2.  Whenever the code gets to a `do_action('my_action_name')`, it'll  run the associated callback function `run_this_function`.  
    
3.  No need to return anything.

## 🔍 Basic Filters (returns filtered data)

Pass in a value, change the value, pass new value back.

```mermaid
flowchart TB

    subgraph register["Registered Filter"]
        add_filter["add_filter( 'my_filter_name', 'run_this_function', $priority, $number_of_args)"]
    end

    subgraph codeflow["Normal code flow"]
        direction TB
        code1["$value_to_be_filtered = 'Andrew'"]
        apply_filters["$new_value = apply_filters( 'my_filter_name', $value_to_be_filtered, $arguments )"]
        code2["echo $new_value"]

        code1 --> apply_filters
        apply_filters --> code2
    end
    

    subgraph callback["Registered Callback Function"]
        callback_function["run_this_function($value, $arguments){ return 'hi! '. $value; }"]
    end


    apply_filters --> register
    register --> callback
    callback --> apply_filters 

```

1. Registered your filter with an `add_filter` referencing a callback function.
2. Run the filter with the `apply_filter` function.
3. The callback function will take the passed value, change it and return it back. (filtering it)
4. MUST return something (the new value).
